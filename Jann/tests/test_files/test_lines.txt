What?
Where'd you get this?
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.

You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life, a fair chance to --

Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
And that is?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
We're due to take off.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
I don't believe it!
Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I. doesn't mint stupid cap troopers.
Daddy?
Very nice.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Oh.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Too aggressive?
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
What are you talking about?
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
Sorry, babe.
Did you say Group 7 access?
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
